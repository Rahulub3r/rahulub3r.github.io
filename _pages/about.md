### *<u>Don't dream about success, work for it</u>*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started Dr. Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" course in the spring of 2016. The course immensely motivated me to learn more and more about the math, the models, their applications, and so on. I started taking other courses online, flew to the US from India to pursue a Masters, applied the learned concepts on projects, interned at a firm, and a lot more.<br />
